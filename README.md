CV
==

Personal CV template based on the moderncv using latex


You can copy these files and change the details to your own, compile them using the CTex in the Windows.
There are two points needed to tell you:
(1) use the xeLetex compile
(2) save the file in the utf8 format.


The Linux version will be developed and updated in the future ^_^

Any questions, please look up the reference of moderncv(http://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) and Latex, 
you can also contact with me to discuss by the email(ustc.sosohu@gmail.com)
